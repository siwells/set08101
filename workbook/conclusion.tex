\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
\paragraph{} We've surveyed a whole lot of topics so far which should lead to a number of conclusions. Firstly, we can't learn everything about the Web from one book. Instead, this one book is just a starting place, but the onus is on you to keep up-to-date with new developments in the field. The second take away is that the Web is a fast moving collection of technologies that have changed over time, and will continue to change. Ultimately, the Web is a reflection of humanity's desire to share information, and to find better ways to use technology to do so. Perhaps that story started when we daubed pigments onto cave walls, or scratched images onto rocks, or perhaps it was with the development of writing systems, or event he printing press. Regardless, that story has not finished yet, and perhaps never will.
\paragraph{} However, if you've liked the topics covered so far in this book, which has focussed on the client side of Web development, perhaps you'll enjoy the follow on book that details server-side development and considers the future of the web.
